Do you have Vue.js front-end capabilities, but lack familiarity with the server side? Would you like to develop the skills needed to build full-stack applications? In this course, instructor Shaun Wassell helps you enhance your development tool kit by showing how to leverage your existing Vue.js skills to build a full-stack ecommerce site. Shaun guides you through the process, showing how to use Vue.js to build a simple front end; Node.js and MongoDB to construct the back end; Axios to communicate between the front and back ends; add authentication with Firebase Authentication; and finally, how to take it live. Along the way, learn how to work with different tools and frameworks to correctly configure your site, including Postman and Express.
